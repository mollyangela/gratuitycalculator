    <h2>Gratuity Calculation Overview</h2>
<p>Gratuity is calculated based on the employee's last basic salary and the number of years worked. The calculation method differs for limited and unlimited contracts.</p>

    <h2>Gratuity for Limited Contracts</h2>
<p>For employees on limited contracts, the gratuity is calculated as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Less than 5 years of service: Employees receive 21 days of salary for each year of service.</li>
<li>5 or more years of service: Employees receive 30 days of salary for each year of service after the completion of five years.</li>
</ul>
   <h2> Gratuity for Unlimited Contracts</h2>
<p>For employees on unlimited contracts, the calculation is similar:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Less than 5 years of service: Employees receive 21 days of salary for each year of service.</li>
<li>5 or more years of service: Employees receive 30 days of salary for each year of service after the completion of five years.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Typical Gratuity Percentages</h2>
<p>The typical gratuity percentages can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the first 5 years of service: 21 days of salary per year, which translates to approximately 70% of a month's salary for each year worked.</li>
<li>For each additional year beyond 5 years: 30 days of salary per year, which is equivalent to 100% of a month's salary for each year worked.</li>
</ul>  
  
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The gratuity calculation is primarily based on the employee's basic salary and the duration of service, with specific formulas for limited and unlimited contracts.
